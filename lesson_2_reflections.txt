What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

A hidden file is created that tracks the directory.  We initialize it to tell git to track the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary area that allows you to set up the files you want to track in the repository.
